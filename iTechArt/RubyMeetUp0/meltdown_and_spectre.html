# Agenda

**Meltdown**

**Spectre**

**What can we do about it?**

---
class: center, middle

# Under the hood

**Processor caches**

**Out-of-order execution**

**Branch prediction**

**Speculative execution**

???

Caches:
1. small fast RAM on processor
2. 64-byte lines
3. Not directly readable

OOO execution:
1. Load X
2. Load Y
3. Load Z
4. temp = Y + Z
5. X = X + temp

Branch prediction:
1. Barriers to OOO
2. Make intillegent guess on previous statistics
3. Undo if wrong

Speculation:
1. Side effects only if branch hit
2. Only if everything ahead of that instruction will also be executed

Kernel memory:
1. Mapped into every process
2. Protected - access causes seg fault

# Meltdown

**Access any RAM directly**

**Intel-specific (but Apple also affected)**

**Easy to fix with OS**

???

Explanation:
1.Fault generated in speculation
2. If in L1, actual data is used
3. Speculative execution uses secret byte
4. Speculation aborted but cache is affected

# Spectre

**Access RAM from privileged process**

**Can work from JS sandbox**

**All modern CPUs are affected**

**Not so easy to fix**

???

Explanation:
1. Bypass JIT safety checks
1.1. Train branch predictor
1.2. Flush caches
1.3. Read memory out of bounds
1.4. Use result to affect cache
1.5. Check access time to see if data is from cache
2. Reveals other process/kernel (privileged) RAM

# What can we do about it?

**OS patches (KAISER)**

**Update browsers**
**Firefox and Chrome have been fixed**

# So what now?

## Military situational indicators progression

**SNAFU**

Situation Normal, All Fucked Up

Thing are running normally.

**TARFUN**

Things Are Really Fucked Up Now

Houston, we have a problem.

**FUBAR**

Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition

Burn it to the ground and start over from scratch; it's totally destroyed.
